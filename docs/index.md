# NAME

pacman-mirrors - generate pacman mirrorlist for Manjaro Linux

# SYNOPSIS
pacman-mirrors [-f*NUMBER*|[[-i[-d]][-c*COUNTRY*[,*COUNTRY*]...|--geoip]]] 
[-a[-p*PREFIX*][-R][-G|-B/-S*BRANCH*][-P*PROTO*[,*PROTO*]...][-U*URL*]] 
[-b*BRANCH*] [-q] [-t*SECONDS*] [-v] [-n]


# DESCRIPTION

Generate mirrorlist for Manjaro Linux. Default is to rank all mirrors by reponse time. If no arguments are given pacman-mirrors lists available options. Pacman-mirrors requires access to files which are read-only so it must be run with su or sudo. To create a up-to-date mirrorlist using all default use,

    pacman-mirrors --fasttrack 10

The mirrorlist generation process can be refined through arguments and arguments with options, for example,

    pacman-mirrors --country Denmark --timeout 5

## IMPORTANT
After all operations **ALWAYS** syncronize your pacman database with

    sudo pacman -Syy

# OPERATION

Some options are mutual exclusive and will throw an arguments error:

* **--branch**, **--get-branch** and **--set-branch**
* **--country** and **--geoip**

Some arguments requires another argument present to have effect. E.g., this command will ignore --default argument

   WRONG
   
    pacman-mirrors -b unstable --default

The *-d/--default* argument tells *-i/--interactive* to force load all mirrors from the mirrorfile

   CORRECT
   
    pacman-mirrors -b unstable --interactive --default

   Or
   
    pacman-mirrors -bunstable -id

The same goes for the API specific arguments. For those to have effect the *-a/--api* argument must be present.

    pacman-mirrors -aS unstable

The arguments can appear in any order except for arguments which takes additional options in which case the options must follow immediately after the argument with or without space, for example

    pacman-mirrors -aB unstable
    pacman-mirrors -aBunstable
    pacman-mirrors -f 5
    pacman-mirrors -f5

Pacman-mirrors always attempt to download the lastest available data from [http://repo.manjaro.org](http://repo.manjaro.org). These data is always used during mirrorlist generation to ensure that you connect to a mirror which is up-to-date for your selected branch. Should you decide to temporarily switch branches you will still connect to an up-to-date mirror.

# ARGUMENTS AND OPTIONS

## IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER
For every mirrorlist generation, you **MUST** run *pacman -Syy*.

## METHODS
-f, \--fasttrack *NUMBER*
:   Generates an up-to-date mirrorlist for the users current selected branch, mirrors are randomly selected from the users current mirrorfile, either a custom mirror file or the default status file, the randomly selected mirrors are ranked by their current access time. The higher number the higher possibility of a fast mirror. If the number 0 is used - it is understood that all mirrors mirrors should be used.

-i, \--interactive [--default]
:   This is a function designed to leave full control for mirrors and protocols to the user. This function **DOES NOT** take into consideration up-to-date mirrors. The addition argument **--default** forces pacman-mirrors to load the default mirror file and ignore any preset custom-mirrors file, thus allowing for reselecting mirrors for a new custom mirror file.

## BRANCH

-b, \--branch *BRANCH*
:   Temporarily use another branch, *stable*, *testing* or *unstable*. The branch is reset with next run of pacman-mirrors.

## COUNTRY
-c, \--country *COUNTRY* [*COUNTRY*] ...
:   Specifiy a country or a list of countries. The list of countries is saved as a custom mirrorfile and the configuration is set to *Custom*

\--geoip
:   Use geolocation if possible, if geoip is not available all mirrors.

-l, \--list, \--country-list
:   Lists available mirror countries.

## API

-a, \--api [-p *PREFIX*] [-R] [-G|-S/-B *BRANCH*] [-P *PROTO* [*PROTO*] ...] [-U *URL*]
:   Instructs pacman-mirrors to activate processing of API arguments

-B, -S, \--set-branch *BRANCH*
:   Permanent change to branch config, using *stable*, *testing* or *unstable*

-G, \--get-branch
:   Return branch from configuration.

-p, \--prefix *PREFIX*
:   Add a path prefix to pacman-mirrors file-handling eg. */mnt/install* or *$mnt*

-P, \--proto, \--protocols *PROTO* [*PROTO*] ...
:   Write protocols to configuration, using *all* or *http*, *https*, *ftp* and *ftps*

-R, \--re-branch
:   Replace branch in mirrorlist

-U, \--url *URL*
:   Replace mirrorlist with supplied url

## MISC

-h, \--help
:   Show the help message

-m, \--method *METHOD*
:   Default method is *rank* but *random* can be selected.

-n, \--no-mirrorlist
:   Use to skip generation of mirrorlist

-q, \--quiet
:   Make pacman-mirrors silent

-t, \--timeout *SECONDS*
:   Change the number of seconds waiting for a server response, SSL enabled mirrors has this value doubled to compensate for the time spent on exchanging encryption keys

-v, \--version
:   Show the version of pacman-mirrors

## Exit status:

    0     : OK
    1     : Problem with argument
    2     : Problem accessing systemfiles
    3     : Missing mirror file
    BRANCH: Value from config

## IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER
For every mirrorlist generation, you **MUST** run *pacman -Syy*.

## Configuration flow of pacman-mirrors

At launch an internal default configuration is setup, file configuration is applied and the commandline is parsed and applied.

## API arguments

These arguments modifies key elements of pacman-mirrors configuration according to the packagers needs.

The actions performed by the API are in strict order and performed *before any* other actions. This also means that ordinary arguments supplied in conjunction with api might be ignored. Eg. **-U** argument terminates pacman-mirrors when branch and mirrorlist has been written.

1. If *-G*
   * print *config.branch*
   * *sys.exit(0)*
2. If *p*  *PREFIX*
   *  add *PREFIX* to internal file configuration
3. If *-S/-B* *BRANCH*
   * apply *BRANCH* to internal configuration
   * replace branch in pacman-mirrors.conf with *BRANCH*
4. If *-U* *URL*
   * apply internal configuration to a mirrorlist with *URL*
   * *sys.exit(0)*
5. If *-P* *PROTO* [*PROTO*] ...
   * replace protocols in pacman-mirrors.conf with *PROTO*
6. If *-R*
   * replace branch in mirrorlist with *-S/-B* *BRANCH*

When done pacman-mirrors checks the internet connection and if possible download the latest datafiles for creating the mirrorlist. At this point it is possible to interrupt further processing.

If the *-n* argument is present pacman-mirrors will now exit.

# EXAMPLES

Most optional arguments are self explaining others require explanation. The API functions is mainly designed to help packagers and iso-builders. However it can be of use for everyone because it takes the hazzle out of editing your pacman-mirrors configuration.

## IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER
For every mirrorlist generation, you **MUST** run *pacman -Syy*.

## Commands
